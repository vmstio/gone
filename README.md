# gone

A tiny Go web server that responds to **every** request with `HTTP 410 Gone`
and a self-contained page mirroring the Mastodon error page
(https://vmst.io/500.htm).

The illustration is embedded into the binary and inlined into the page as a
base64 data URI, so the app has no external dependencies and serves a single
410 response per request. Dark mode follows the browser's
`prefers-color-scheme`.

## Run locally

```sh
go run .
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

Listens on `$PORT` (default `8080`).

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8080/
# HTTP/1.1 410 Gone
```

## Endpoints

- `/*` — returns `410 Gone` with the HTML page.
- `/healthz` — returns `200 OK` for platform health checks.

## Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform

App Platform's native Go buildpack builds this with no Dockerfile. The included
[`.do/app.yaml`](.do/app.yaml) app spec configures the service and points the
health check at `/healthz` (App Platform treats a 410 as unhealthy, so the
default `/` health check would fail).

Create the app from the dashboard (pointing at this repo) or with the CLI:

```sh
doctl apps create --spec .do/app.yaml
```

Update the `github.repo` field in `.do/app.yaml` to match your repository.
